		@color = "BurlyWood"

		# Also translating it to twice the height, as we want to stack two of these cubes together in the assembly.
		bolt = Bolt.new(4,40).mirror(z:1).translate(z:@z*2)

		# We also want a nut. And since the printing direction is from the bottom, we decide to add support to it.
		nut = Nut.new(4,support:true,support_layer_height:0.3)

		# substracting the @hardware array will call the .output method on each hardware item automatically

		# colorize is a convenience thing to colorize your part differently in assemblies.
		# You can specify @color in initalize (as default color), or set a different color in the assembly this way.
		res = colorize(res)

		# Note: Make sure you do this before adding parts (i.e. hardware) that have their own color and that
		#				you do not want to colorize.

		# You can go ahead and show the hardware when the part produces its 'show' output file by uncommenting this:
		#		res += @hardware if show
		# However, in this example, the Assembly file calls show_hardware in order to not show it twice.

		# always make sure the lowest statement always returns the object that you're working on
		res
